/*
 * Update protocol state machine.
 *
 * This module assembles incoming bytes into frames, validates each
 * one, executes the corresponding command and emits the response.
 * It does not know the transport layer: it consumes whatever
 * uart_getc() provides and transmits via uart_write(). Porting to
 * CAN would only touch those two points.
 *
 * The behavior mirrors that of tools/bootloader_sim.py, which
 * serves as the executable specification and whose 64 tests
 * describe the expected edge cases.
 *
 * Lazy erase
 * ----------
 * The simulator erases the entire slot at the start of a transfer.
 * On silicon, 480 KB represents 240 pages at roughly twenty
 * milliseconds each, nearly five seconds of unavailability —
 * for a firmware that may occupy only 20 KB.
 *
 * This module therefore erases page by page, just before writing.
 * The 256-byte block size divides the 2048-byte page exactly, so
 * every page boundary coincides with a block boundary: the test
 * reduces to offset % FLASH_PAGE_SIZE == 0.
 *
 * Injected time base
 * ------------------
 * protocol_poll() receives the current time as a parameter rather
 * than depending on a timer. The module remains testable on a PC,
 * and the choice of time source — SysTick, TIM, other — belongs
 * to the caller.
