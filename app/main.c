/*
 * Application -- demonstrates the update lifecycle.
 *
 * Self-confirmation
 * -----------------
 * The bootloader jumps to a TESTING image after incrementing its
 * failure counter. If the application does nothing, that counter
 * reaches the threshold after a few restarts and the bootloader
 * switches back to the previous slot.
 *
 * That is the rollback mechanism itself: a correct CRC proves the
 * image's integrity, not its correctness. A firmware transmitted
 * without a single corrupted bit can still crash within its first
 * second.
 *
 * The application must therefore confirm its own start-up: set the
 * state to VALID and clear the counter. Without that confirmation no
 * rollback is possible -- but without it, no firmware survives past
 * three boots either.
 *
 * When to confirm
 * ---------------
 * Confirming on the first line of main() would empty the mechanism
 * of meaning: an application that crashes moments later would still
 * have been declared healthy.
 *
 * What counts as a successful start depends on the product. Here a
 * few complete application cycles are required. A real system would
 * confirm after checking its peripherals, establishing a link, or
 * meeting whatever criterion is meaningful for it.
 *
 * Inherited watchdog
 * ------------------
 * The bootloader started the IWDG before jumping, and it can no
 * longer be stopped. This application must therefore refresh it, or
 * it will be reset after three seconds -- which advances the failure
 * counter and, after three attempts, triggers rollback.
 *
 * That is the mechanism working as intended: an application that
 * hangs has no way to keep refreshing, so its failure is detected
 * without it having to report anything.
 *
 * Refreshing here is conditional on the application cycle having
 * advanced. An unconditional refresh would only catch a complete
 * hang: a program looping over a section that happens to contain the
 * call would keep the watchdog quiet while doing nothing useful.
 *
 * OTA trigger
 * -----------
 * The main loop also watches the serial link for a request to hand
 * control back to the bootloader, so that an update needs neither the
 * reset button nor a debugger. The application sets the boot request
 * flag (shared/boot_request.h) and resets itself; the bootloader finds
 * the flag and stretches its listen window.
 *
 * The confirmation this trigger requires, and why it is a streak of
 * polls rather than a magic word, is argued where it is implemented.

 * OTA trigger
 *
 * The host asks for an update by holding the serial line down with
 * OTA_TRIGGER_BYTE. The application acts on it only after several
 * consecutive polls have seen that character and nothing else.
 *
 * A single byte was the first version and it was not safe. This
 * reboots the board into a bootloader listen window, and the only
 * thing between a stray byte and that reboot was the byte's value: a
 * terminal left open on the port, one keystroke, a byte still in RDR
 * from before the jump. Everywhere else in this project the host link
 * is framed, sequenced and CRC'd precisely because a bare byte stream
 * cannot be trusted; the trigger had no business being the exception.
 *
 * The obvious repair -- a multi-byte magic word -- does not work on
 * this receive path. With no interrupt and no ring buffer, each pass
 * reads at most one byte and RDR holds exactly one; a magic word sent
 * in a single write arrives in forty microseconds and everything past
 * its first byte is lost to the overrun. Matching a sequence needs a
 * driver this application deliberately does not carry.
 *
 * So the confirmation is built along the axis that is available:
 * time. A host holding the line down for a couple of seconds passes;
 * a stray byte scores one poll and the next one erases it. Losing
 * bytes to overrun is harmless because the host keeps sending -- which
 * is exactly what makes this fit a buffer-less receive path, instead
 * of fighting it.
